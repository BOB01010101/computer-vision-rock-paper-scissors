# Computer Vision RPS

# Used Teachable-Machine to create a model.

 Used the website Teach-able Machine to create a model:

https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com


 Each class was trained with images shown to the camera of the three options in the game: rock, paper, scissor.  The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image.

# Download the model 

once the model had been created using the platform above, the model was downloaded from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. 
The model was named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels was named labels.txt.

The downloaded files contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model.
*They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside.*
